# Deep Learning Labs
# Overview
This repository contains a collection of deep learning lab assignments completed as part of a course or project. Each lab focuses on different computer vision tasks using widely adopted deep learning models and techniques.

## Repository Structure
## Lab 1: Binary Segmentation using MobileNetV1

Implements binary image segmentation using the lightweight MobileNetV1 architecture.
Includes training code, data preprocessing, and evaluation scripts.

## Lab 2: Binary Semantic Segmentation of Water using U-Net

Focuses on semantic segmentation of water regions in images using the U-Net architecture.
Contains all necessary components for training, validation.

## Getting Started
Each lab folder includes its own:
1. `main.py`
2. `model.py`
3. `train.py`
4. `mydataloader.py`
And other useful scripts
